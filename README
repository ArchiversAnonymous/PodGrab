Do with this code what you will, it's "open source". As a courtesy,
I would appreciate credit if you base your code on mine. If you find
a bug or think the code sucks balls, please let me know :-) 

Outstanding issues:-
 - Video podcasts which which are not direct URLs and are modified by PodGrab
   in order to be grabbed won't display their size as the filenames haven't 
   been stripped of their garbage URL info yet. It'll say 0 bytes, but don't 
   worry, they've downloaded.
